Operating System Functions
1. User Interface - An operating system provides its users with an interface they can use to interact with their computer.
    Styles of interface will vary. For example, some operating systems use a visual interface in which users can interact
    with virtual files and folders. Others are all text based, requiring the user to read through lines of text to see what
    they're interacting with, and interact with those items through typed commands.
2. Manage Resources - An operating system needs to be able to manage different resources. For example, it needs to be able to
    manage sound, the display, its internet connection, etc. An operating system should be able to juggle all of those types
    of things without the user having to think too hard about it.
