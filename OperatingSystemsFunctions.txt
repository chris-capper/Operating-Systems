Operating System Functions
1. User Interface - An operating system provides its users with an interface they can use to interact with their computer.
    Styles of interface will vary. For example, some operating systems use a visual interface in which users can interact
    with virtual files and folders. Others are all text based, requiring the user to read through lines of text to see what
    they're interacting with, and interact with those items through typed commands.
2. Manage Resources - An operating system needs to be able to manage different resources. For example, it needs to be able to
    manage sound, the display, its internet connection, etc. An operating system should be able to juggle all of those types
    of things without the user having to think too hard about it.
3. Controlling Hardware - Just like the need to manage resources, the operating system needs to be able to control and manage
    the hardware of your computer as well. This would include things like the memory, the GPU, and the CPU. Again, an operating
    system is designed to be able to manage all this stuff behind the scenes so most users shouldn't have to think about it
    too much.
